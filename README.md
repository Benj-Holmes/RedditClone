# Reddit Clone 
A React and Redux project using API calls to mimic rediit's features.

## Project Description
This project was created to test my skills of using both React and Redux, the user can search for any subreddit, select from a list of popular ones, and then select a thread to read. This project does not use the full reddit API so that the user does not need to log in to access anything, because of this some of reddits features are not present, but otherwise i am very happy with the turnout and i think i have used the API to its fullest potential.

 While making this project i gained an understanding why redux is often used for state management, and i can see why it would only become more useful the bigger the app becomes, it is very convienient to be able to use part of your state at any time with a selector, and it's much simpler than passing state down through layers of components.
 
I added some extra features like a toggle for a light and dark mode, responsive design for all devices and a loading state to display before the API call finishes to make the app feel more complete.

## Site Demonstration
